                                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team

                                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
